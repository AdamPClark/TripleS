# TripleS - Solar System Simulator

A Python-based solar system simulator that models celestial body orbits using Keplerian orbital parameters. This project will start with predefined orbits and can be extended to include real physics simulations.

## Features

- Simulate planetary orbits using Keplerian orbital elements
- Visualize solar system dynamics
- Extensible architecture for adding new celestial bodies
- Educational tool for understanding orbital mechanics
