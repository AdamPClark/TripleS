# Contributing to TripleS

Welcome! We're excited that you want to contribute to the TripleS solar system simulator. This guide will help you get started, especially if you're new to GitHub.

## Getting Started with GitHub

If you're new to GitHub, here are the basic concepts:

- **Repository (repo)**: The project folder containing all the code
- **Issue**: A way to track bugs, feature requests, or tasks
- **Fork**: Your own copy of the repository
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge your changes into the main project

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Look for Issues
1. Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues)
2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are perfect for beginners
3. Read through the issue description
4. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### Step 2: Work on the Issue
1. Fork the repository (click the "Fork" button)
2. Clone your fork to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TripleS.git
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes (run any existing tests)

### Step 3: Submit Your Changes
1. Add and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of what you changed"
   ```
2. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-name
   ```
3. Create a Pull Request from your fork to the main repository
